Q: I can't figure out how to uncompress the NeoStats-x.x.x.tar.gz file how do I do ti?

A: in your shell type: tar xvfz NeoStats-x.x.x.tar.gz


Q: I'm typing compile in the directory but it isn't working, whats wrong?

A: You have to type "make" without the quotes.


Q: I am typing stats but it says no file/directory, how do I load it?

A: One some systems you can't just type "stats" you need to start it with "./stats"
   without the quotes.


Q: Ok I've ran it, but when it tries to connect to my server I get a message saying
   "No N Line!"  How do I add one?

A: edit your ircd.conf file and and add C/N lines for StatServ, also add U: lines for
   it while your there.  If you can't figure out how to add them refer to the documentation
   that came with your IRCd.


Q: When I started NeoStats for the first time it flooded me with new records.  Why does it
   do this? It scared the bajesus outa me!

A: When you first install it, there are no Statistics so it creates them when it is first ran
   That is what you are experiencing.


Q: How do I install modules I downloaded from your website?

A: ** NOTE: Currently Modules Listed on the WEBSITE will NOT function with
      NeoStats 2.5.0 Beta copies.
   Upload the module file into the \2module\2 directory
   Type either:
   a) 'tar xvfz Module-x.x.tar.gz'",
   or",
   b) 'gzip -d Module-x.x.tar.gz' Followed by 'tar xvf Module-x.x.tar'
   Once This is done enter the directory the files were unpacked to
   type 'make' (Ignore any 'errors' that appear)
   In an IRC window type '/msg NeoStats load modulename' where 'modulename'
   is the name of the directory that the module was unpacked to

   Note: Once the module has been 'made' you can make the module load when
   NeoStats is loaded by editing the stats.cfg file. Adding 'LOAD_MODULE modulename
   in the Module section will ensure this happens the next time NeoStats is loaded


Q: When I compile modules I get a Pointer Type Error HELP!

A: The solution to this problem is to simply ignore the message
   the message does not affect the running of the module or NeoStats.


Q: What is 'sumyungguy'

A: sumyungguy is the spam module. It no longer changes its name...
   rather, it sits and waits for a user to spam it before it echos
   the spammer's message, nick & hostname information.


Q: What IRCD and Services Does The Team Reccomend?

A: The NeoStats Team Recommends Unreal IRCd and Ultimate IRCd,
   as those are the only two currently supported IRCds.  Check
   ./configure --help for more information.
   We also recommend Epona Services, however NeoStats will also
   function with other services such as Daylight II.
   Further IRCd support includes Hybrid, Bahamut and ircu.


Q: What Operating System does NeoStats Run on?

A: NeoStats runs best under any Linux/Unix Based Enivornment.
   NeoStats now runs fine on BSD system.
   NeoStats DOES NOT RUN UNDER MACINTOSH OR WINDOWS!!!


Q: Does NeoStats API support multiple Nicks?

A: The short answer to this question is 'yes'. Some time
   back development started on the NeoStats Channel Services
   to replace the Epona services currently used and be fully
   intergrated with NeoStats. During this design a module with
   multiple nick's was deisgned and so was a patch to the API
   which enabled this feature. At this stage there are no plans
   to release the multiple nicks API, but rather intergate it
   into the NeoStats-2.5 release.


Q: I have a really good idea for a module, will you make it?

A: It really depends on what the module is for... but we will
   take suggestions and comments and probably end up doing them :P
   A good example of this is the HTML stats output in StatServ and
   the design of HostServ.

Q: When I try to LOAD or UNLOAD modules I get an ACCEDD DENIED msg! why?

A: To operate NeoStats you must have either Tech-Admin or Net-Admin
   privileges. You may want to check that you have those flags
   before you try the command.

   The old standard for NeoStats was 'Tech Admin' or higher...
   this flag is fading away and in the newer versions of NeoStats,
   the new standard is 'Net Admin' or higher.



Q: Will there ever be a Windows Version of NeoStats?

A: The NeoStats team has considered porting a windows platform
   of NeoStats on many occasions. At this stage we feel that
   we will create a windows version from the release that is
   due out shortly (NeoStats-2.5). We are currently in the  
   process of fine-tuning and debugging the new and old code   
   of NeoStats. However, don't be surprised if no windows
   version is available until a few releases later. Once we
   have the remaining bugs ironed out, a windows version has a
   50% chance of happening.


Q: Will the modules with NeoStats 2.5.0 work on older versions?

A: NO!  These modules are for this version ONLY.  They will NOT
   function with older versions of NeoStats.  Make sure you are using
   ONLY the most current modules from our Website.
   ** NOTE: Beta Users DO NOT DOWNLOAD MODULES FROM OUR SITE THEY
            ARE FOR NEOSTATS 2.0.13 AND WILL NOT WORK WITH NEOSTATS 2.5.0

   The team decided to make a large number of changes to NeoStats,
   causing the development version NeoStats-2.1 to be incremented 
   to NeoStats-2.5. In doing this, code used for the modules was 
   slightly modified and therefore the older modules will not work
   on the new version of NeoStats. And vice versa. 



Q: Can I send you guys some money for this?

A: Yes, in small unmarked bills. ;)
