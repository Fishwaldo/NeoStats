NeoStats 2.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

---------------------------------------
PLEASE READ THE 'BETA' FILE NOW
---------------------------------------

Thanks for Downloading NeoStats. NeoStats is a powerfull and extendable set
of *services* for IRC. By Services, we do not mean NickServ/Chanserv etc 
(although those are being developed) but additional services. Things like
StatServ which give you information on the number of users/operators/channels/servers
... basically IRC statistics, or MoraleServ, which is a *fun* module, to send
funny messages to users, to utility modules. Some modules have a usefull function
 on your network, other modules are developed for fun, and to make your IRC 
network more attractive to users (thats whats it all about right?, IRC users?)
With the release of 2.5 series of NeoStats, several changes have taken place 
compared to the old version of NeoStats 2.0 series (don't ask me what happened
to versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4, I don't know!)
A detailed list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog file, but a brief summary is:
	-ServiceRoots support
	-External MOTD files
	-Module Segfault protection
	-CrossIRCD support. We now support Other IRCD's apart from just Unreal
	-StatServ supports dumping Statistics to a HTML file for output (the output of the HTML file is based on a template)
	-Changes to the ModuleAPI that make it nicer
	-Channel Support!
	-StatServ supports Channel Statistics now!
	-Many bugfixes and changes to the internal NeoStats core
	-Many updates to the various Modules

Anyway, enough ranting, its time to move on....

	[4.1] Where to get support
	[4.2] What information you should provide for support

[1] Installation:
-------------
	[1.1] Getting Started.

		First off, you're going to want to uncompress NeoStats to do this type the following:

		tar xvfz NeoStats2.0.tar.gz (this may vary depending on the version you run of Neo
					     change the NeoStats2.0.tar.gz to match your filename )

		** Note: For some systems that don't run a new version of tar you may have to do this:
			 gzip -d NeoStats2.0.tar.gz
			 tar xvf NeoStats2.0.tar


	[1.2] Running configure
		The configure script has been changed compared to the old 2.0.x 
		releases and you must now make sure you supply the right arguments
		to configure.

		What is required:
		-----------------
		IRCD Support:
			To specify the IRCD you are compiling for. eg:
			--enable-unreal		for UnrealIRCD
			--enable-ultimate2 	for UltimateIRCD 2.x.x Series of IRCD's
			--enable-ultimate3	for UltimateIRCD 3.x.x Serices of IRCD's (Note, at the time of release of this version of NeoStats, Ultimate 3.x.x was still in alpha, it is possible that Ultimate3 compatibility might break in future releases of Ultimate as it matures)

		What is optional:
		-----------------
		Privledge System:
			Originally, NeoStats was based on Operator Flags on a network.
			If you had TechAdmin on Unreal, you were basically allowed full control to
			Neostats. Now though, you can enable what is called External
			Authentication. This allows different ways of the NeoStats Privledge system.
			The Currently available options are:
			--enable-auth=sr 	This Enables a ServiceRoots option, which a user must be identified to services  (with the +r flag) and they will have full access to NeoStats.
			if you do not specify --enable-auth then it uses IRCD flags for access to NeoStats
			Default is IRCD		This reverts back to the old NeoStats Privledge system, where Authenication is based on the users flags (+oOANs etc etc)

		Modules Support:
			NeoStats has a expanding set of modules. Some Modules have their own --enable options, while other modules do not.
			To enable a module at compile time (or multiple modules) use the following option:
			--enable-modules="statserv spam"	this would enable the statserv and spam modules.
			
			Defaults are no modules are compiled. NeoStats ships by default with StatServ and Spam modules (as well as the version module, which is really a useless module. Its a example of the API for module coders to use.

			if you have downloaded additional modules from the NeoStats website, DO NOT specify them in the enable-modules option. Each module has its own configure script, and must be configured and installed after NeoStats is installed.

		Debuging:
			Most users will never look at this option. It compiles NeoStats
			with debuging turned on. I would only suggest using this if you have
			problems are are about to fill out a bug form.
			--enable-debug		Enables Debugging

	[1.3] Compiling NeoStats

		Ok, you should now be back at a shell prompt, now type:

		make

		it will go through the source and compile it into an executable binary file.
		If you get some warnings, please ignore them -- we are working on the warnings.

		[1.4] Installing NeoStats

		with version 2.5.0 and higher, NeoStats now needs to be "installed" into its own directory if you wish to use additional modules
		By default NeoStats will install into ~/NeoStats/ (in your home directory, eg, /home/fish/NeoStats/)
		if you wish to change the install location, please see the section 2.
		To install NeoStats type:

		make install

		This will create the necessary files, and copy them to the installation directory. 



	[1.5] Setting up the stats.cfg file

		Now you should change to the installation directory (~/NeoStats/, or whatever you specified in ./configure)

		once in this directory, you need to edit the configuration file. A template is provided called stats.cfg.dist
		copy this file to stats.cfg and edit the file. All the options are pretty self explainatory.
		if you have a question please feel free to ask me.. Once you are done editting the file Press 
		NOTE: some additional modules, like StatServ or scriptserv have additional configuration options that must be specified in the stats.cfg file. Please see the documentation for the individual modules on available configuration options

		The available options are:
		SERVER_NAME	- Specifies the name of the NeoStats Server as it will apear on the network. 
			eg: SERVER_NAME stats.neostats.net		-When the Server links, it will apear as stats.neostats.net.
		SERVER_PORT	- Specifies the port to connect to on the IRC Server
			eg: SERVER_PORT 6667		-When connecting, NeoStats will connect to port 6667
		CONNECT_TO	- Specifies the IP address to connect to.
			eg: CONNECT_TO 127.0.0.1	- This will force stats to connect to 127.0.0.1
		CONNECT_PASS	-Specifies the password used to connect. This must match your CN lines in your IRCD configuration
			eg:	CONNECT_PASS linkpass	- Send "linkpass" as the password to connect
		SERVER_INFOLINE	-Specify the description of the server that appears when you do /links
			eg: SERVER_INFOLINE Network Auxilurary Services	
		SERVICES_CHAN	-Specify the channel that all bots on NeoStats will automatically join, and echo out any important information
			eg: SERVICES_CHAN #services	-Makes NeoStats, and all the other bots join #services channel on startup/load
		WANT_PRIVMSG		-Specify if the bots should send all messages as privmsg's or as notices (Most Services use notice)
			eg: WANT_PRIVMSG	- if present, will send all messages as Privmsg's (if commented out, it will send as Notices)
		RECONNECT_TIME	-If NeoStats server gets split from the network, how long to wait before attempting to reconnect
			eg RECONNECT_TIME 10	-Specifies wait 10 seconds before trying to reconnect
		LOAD_MODULE	-what module to load at startup. Multiple instances of LOAD_MODULE may be specified
			eg LOAD_MODULE statserv	-Will load up StatServ at Startup

		if you have enabled the ServiceRoots authentication module, the the additional configuration options are available:
		SERVICE_ROOTS	-Who should get access to NeoStats regardless of their O line flags (apart from having the Umode +r, which means they identified to Nickserver) You 						can specify this option upto 10 times to specify different nicks
			eg SERVICE_ROOTS fish	-Will give "fish" access to NeoStats privledged commands if fish has Umode +r
		SERVICE_ROOTS_AUTH	-Should we only give access to NeoStats privledged command to the nicks listed in SERVICE_ROOTS and ignore users O line flags?
			eg: SERVICE_ROOTS_AUTH 1	-Enable, and only let fish access NeoStats, regardless of O line flags


	[1.6] Finished!

		Ok, your all done now. 
		** Note: Make sure your server(S) have U: lines for your stats server.
		**       Please Please Please! Remember to add the proper C & N lines
			 on your server as well!

		Once your CNU lines are setup, you need to start stats. That is as simple as ./stats

		If anything goes wrong, there *might* be a error message in the log files. Have a look in ~/NeoStats/logs/stats.log it might give you a clue to whats wrong!


		** FINAL NOTICE ** ** FINAL NOTICE ** ** FINAL NOTICE ** ** FINAL NOTICE **
		I WILL NOT ASSIST YOU WITH ADDING C: N: AND U: LINES TO YOUR SERVER, 
		YOU SHOULD READ THE IRCd's DOCUMENTATION IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO IT!!!

[2] NeoStats Bot Help
	[2.1] stats.cfg options
	The following options are available for the NeoStats bot in stats.cfg:
	NEOSTATS_HOST	- Specifies the Hostname that NeoStats apears to come from

		StatServ also puts out some information on when the page was created, and what software created it by default at the end of your HTML page. This option can not be disabled. (Sorry, but its our little advertisment for all the hard work we have done to create NeoStats for you to use!)
		A example template is provided for you so you don't have to waste time getting your own template ready. If you wish to create your own template, replace the index.tpl file in the data directory with your version.

[4] Support Information
	[4.1] Where to get support

		Finally, you can email support@neostats.net
	[4.2] What to provide when requesting support.
		It always helps to provide as much information about your enviroment when asking for help. Please make sure you include the following information:
			Operating system version (ie, Redhat, Mandrake etc)

		We may request that you enable debugging and submit us the results of debugging. if this is the case, we need you to re-run configure with the following option:
		./configure --enable-debug (any other options you need, like IRCD type and module lists)
		"make"
		./stats
		When it crashes, or the bug has been reproduced, please send us:
		logs/stats.log
