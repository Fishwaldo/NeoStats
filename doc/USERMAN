NeoStats Commands:
(*note all commands are prefixed with /msg StatServ <COMMAND>)



IRC Operator Commands: (+o)
---------------------------

HELP   - This will list all commands currently available to you, you can alternatively do a HELP
         on a command it lists.
       USAGE: /msg StatServ HELP    OR   /msg StatServ HELP COMMAND

SERVER - This Command gives you information on a specific server.  For Instance, if I wanted some
         information on always.dreaming.org, I would enter /msg Statserv SERVER always.dreaming.org
         It would then tell me the current users connected to that server, the manimum users ever
         on that server, current opers, max opers, ircop kills, server kills, Low/High Pings,
         the current ping, and if the server has ever split away from the network.
      USAGE: /msg StatServ SERVER someserver.network.net

MAP    - This Command will give you Network Map Information on all server, basically it will tell you
         Current/Max Users per server, Current/Max Opers per server, and the servers current Lag.
      USAGE: /msg StatServ MAP

UPTIME - This command will tell you how long NeoStats has been running for and list some of the
         settings which you defined in the stats.cfg file.
       USAGE: /msg StatServ UPTIME

NETSTATS - This command will tell you the current amount of users on the network, the maximum
           amount that has ever been on the network at once, current network opers, max opers,
           users currently set away, current servers, and maximum servers ever connected to the
           network.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ NETSTATS

DAILY    - This command will give you the DAILY Network Statstics.  It will list today's max
           servers, users, and opers.  * NOTE: The statistics given with this command are
           automatically reset every night at Midnight.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ DAILY

TLD      - I know this command confuses the hell out of a lot of people, so I will explain it
           in detail here.  TLD Stands for Top Level Domain.  A top level domain can be one
           of the following, but not limited to these examples: .ca, .us, .mx, .pe, .be
           What are those you may ask?  Those stand for countries for instance, .ca is Canada
           .us is United States, .mx is Mexico, .pe is Peru, and .be is Belgium.  This command
           is useful if you have no idea what country they are from.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ TLD CA

TLDMAP   - This is Top Level Domain MAP.  It will show you what hosts (.ca, .us, etc) that
           your users are connecting from and post a percentage of the connections for each.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ TLDMAP

OPERLIST - This one will be broken down in a few examples. :P  OPERLIST alone will show you
           All Online Opers.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ OPERLIST

      + NOAWAY - This will only show IRCOPS who are NOT Set as being away.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ OPERLIST NOAWAY

      + TECH   - This will only show TECHADMINS who are on the network, no other opers.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ OPERLIST TECH

      + NET    - This will only show NETADMINS who are on the network, no other opers.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ OPERLIST NET

      + SERVER - This will only show you opers on a specific server.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ OPERLIST SERVER some.ircserver.net

BOTLIST  - This command will show you ALL online BOTS. (umode +B)
         USAGE: /msg StatServ BOTLIST

VERSION  - This Command will show you the current version of NeoStats that your network
           is running.  It is always recommended to check our website for a newer copy
           then the one you are currently running, and alternatively sign up for our
           mailing list.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ VERSION





IRC TechAdmin Commands (+T):
----------------------------

SHUTDOWN - This command will SHUTDOWN StatServ, it will need to be manually restarted.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ SHUTDOWN REASON    (where REASON is your reason for shutting down)

RELOAD   - This command will force StatServ to Disconnect from the Network for a few seconds
           then reconnect.  Useful if StatServ is lagging.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ RELOAD REASON     (where REASON is your reason for reloading)

RESET    - This command is PURE EVIL!  It will DELETE all Statstics and Disconnect from the
           Network then reconnect.  If you want to delete all Statistics this is the way to
           do it.  (*Note: Once we finish the HTML writeouts this will reset those also)
         USAGE: /msg StatServ RESET

JOIN     - This command will force StatServ to JOIN a channel, but it will make StatServ leave
           the logging channel.  THIS IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED AGAINST.  If you use this StatServ
           will then send all logging msgs to the NEW channel.  TRY NOT TO USE THIS COMMAND.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ JOIN #Channel

STATS    - This command has many uses so I will cover them all individually. :P

       + DEL - This will delete a server's statistics from StatServ so they can start over.
               ONLY the server specified will have its stats removed.
     USAGE: /msg StatServ STATS DEL server.somenet.com

       + LIST - This will list the current servers for which Statserv is keeping stats for.
     USAGE: /msg StatServ STATS LIST

       + COPY - This will copy a servers statistics onto another servers.  The other server will
                then have max users/max opers the same as the other, most people don't use this
                command at all.
     USAGE: /msg StatServ COPY this.serber.com thatserve.com


LOGS     - This command will MSG you the current LOG FILE StatServ has.  It is highly discouraged
           in using this command as it will lag yourself and StatServ and possibly even disconnect
           you from the network.  Chances are if you have access to this command, you should have
           shell acces, much safer/easier to log into the shell and read the logfile.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ LOGS

RAW      - Send a RAW command from StatServ.  Again most people don't use this, and chances are
           we'll be re-designing it to be a tad friendlier. :P
         USAGE: /msg StatServ RAW command(s)





IRC Coder Commands (+1):
------------------------  

Debug    - Toggle Debug Mode.  This will show you everything StatServ is doing.
           Warning: Running this on a Popular Network can flood you off the server.
         USAGE: /msg StatServ DEBUG
