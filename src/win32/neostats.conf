# NeoStats Server Configuration #
#################################

ServerConfig {
# NAME = "<hostname>" [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the name of the NeoStats Server as it will appear on 
#    the network. e.g. 
#      
#          SERVER_NAME = "stats.neostats.net"
#      
#    When NeoStats links, it will appear as stats.neostats.net.
  Name = "stats.somenet.net"

# INFO = "<info line>" [REQUIRED]
#    Specify the description of the server that
#    appears when you do /links e.g.
#    
#        INFO "Network Auxiliary Services"
  Info = "NeoStats 3.0 IRC Services"

# SERVICECHANNEL="#<channel name>" [REQUIRED]
#    Specify the channel that all bots on NeoStats
#    will automatically join, and echo out any
#    important information e.g.
#    
#        SERVICECHANNEL="#services"
#        
#    Makes NeoStats, and all the other bots join #services channel on 
#    start-up/load.
  ServiceChannel = "#services"

# SERVER_NUMERIC = <numeric> [RECOMMENDED]
#    Specify the numeric of the server to send on connect.
#    This must be a value between 1 and 254, and must not be in use by
#    any other IRC server on the network.  
#    
#        SERVER_NUMERIC = 1
  ServerNumeric = 1

# BINDTO = <ip address or hostname> [OPTIONAL]
#    Make NeoStats bind to a particular IP Address. If not
#    specified NeoStats will attempt to find this address
#    itself. e.g. 
#    
#        BINDTO 203.203.123.12
#    
#    All outgoing connections from NeoStats will originate from this 
#    IP address
#    This IP address should not be localhost (127.0.0.1)
  BindTo = "127.0.0.1 <- CHANGETHIS!!"

# PROTOCOL = "<protocol>" [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the protocol module to use.
#    Valid protocol options are:

# NeoStats Option Configuration #
#################################


Options {
# RECONNECTTIME = <seconds> [RECOMMENDED]
#    If NeoStats server gets split from the network, how long to wait 
#    before attempting to reconnect to the network. A value of 0 will 
#    cause NeoStats to shutdown and not attempt to reconnect. e.g.
#    
#        RECONNECTTIME = 10    
#    
#    Specifies wait 10 seconds before trying to reconnect
#        
#        RECONNECT_TIME = 0
#    
#    Tells NeoStats to never reconnect to the network
#    
#    If not specified, NeoStats will default to 10 seconds.
  ReconnectTime = 10

# USEPRIVMSG = <true/false> [DISCOURAGED]
#    Specify if the bots should send all messages as privmsgs or as 
#    notices (Most Services use notice) e.g.
#     
#        USEPRIVMSG true
#    
#    If present or set to true, will send all messages as privmsgs (if commented out, 
#    it will send as Notices) *NOTE:* This option Violates IRC RFC, and 
#    can cause flooding problems on your network. Its NOT recommended. 
  UsePrivmsg = false

# OPERONLY = <true/false> [OPTIONAL]
#    Restrict NeoStats and StatServ to opers use only.
#    If not specified, users will have some access to NeoStats
#    and StatServ commands. e.g.
#    
#        OPERONLY=true 
#        
#    Only opers may use NeoStats and StatServ.
  OperOnly = false

# SERVERSETTIME=<INTERVAL> [OPTIONAL]
#    Cause NeoStats to sync server times at the given interval
#    INTERVAL is an integer representing the number of hours
#        
#    Examples
#        
#        SERVERSETTIME=24
#    
#    Cause NeoStats to sync server times every 24 hours
#    If not present, NeoStats will not sync times.
#    This option only works on servers that support this and
#    defaults to a sync interval of 24 hours. Enabling this
#    option will also cause NeoStats to sync servers when it
#    first joins the network.
  ServerSettime = 24

# DatabaseType = "<dbm>" [OPTIONAL]
#    Specifies the database manager module to use.
#    NeoStats will default to GDBM if this is not provided.
#    Valid options are:
#          gdbm
#
#          DatabaseType = "gdbm"
#      
#
  DatabaseType = "gdbm"

# LOGFILENAMEFORMAT = "<format>" [OPTIONAL]
#    Defines the format for dated log files. This allows you to choose 
#    what date format is used for log file names when they are rotated at 
#    midnight. The option uses the parameters passed to strftime so you 
#    can use any options valid for that function. Common ones are:
#        %a  Abbreviated weekday name 
#        %A  Full weekday name 
#        %b  Abbreviated month name 
#        %B  Full month name 
#        %d  Day of month as decimal number (01 – 31) 
#        %m  Month as decimal number (01 – 12) 
#        %y  Year without century, as decimal number (00 – 99) 
#        %Y  Year with century, as decimal number 
#
#    Examples using 30 September 2003 as the date:
#    For NeoStats0930.log:
#        
#        LOGFILENAMEFORMAT="%m%d"
#    
#    For NeoStats20030930.log:
#    
#        LOGFILENAMEFORMAT="%Y%m%d"
#    
#    If not defined, the default is the original NeoStats log format of
#    "-%m-%d" i.e. NeoStats-09-30.log
  #LogFileNameFormat = "-%m-%d"

# ROOTNICK = "<nick>" [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the nick of the NeoStats root bot
#    e.g. 
#

#      
#    When NeoStats links, it create a root bot with nick NeoStats
  RootNick = "NeoStats"

# SERVICESHOST = "<hostname>" [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the default host of NeoStats service bots
#    e.g. 
#      
#          SERVICEHOST="stats.net"
#      
#    Service bots will now we user@stats.net
#    If not specified NeoStats will default to the server name
  ServicesHost = "stats.net"

# NOLOAD = true [YOU MUST REMOVE THIS]
#    If this is in the neostats.conf your NeoStats WILL NOT START UP. To 
#    disable this simply comment this line out. e.g.
#        
#        NOLOAD = true  <- NeoStats will not load.
#        
#        #NOLOAD = true <- NeoStats will load.
#
#        NOLOAD = false <- Neostats will load.
  NOLOAD = true

# NeoNetConfigurations and Loading  #
#####################################

# NeoNet is a protocol that links all NeoStats installations back to the main
# NeoStats sites, such as http://secure.irc-chat.net etc.
# This allows you to take advantage of some of the aditional features or modules
# that we support, such as updated definitions for SecureServ accounts, or 
# reporting options for OPSB.

# You must visit http://accounts.neostats.net/ to create your NeoNet account
# and select what aditional options you would like. (some might require 3rd
# party modules, such as SecureServ or OPSB). 

# If you have been using SecureServ on the 2.5 series, please visit
# http://accounts.neostats.net/migrate/ for information on how to 
# use your existing Secure.irc-chat.net account with NeoNet.
NeoNet {

# This is the username, as supplied on the NeoNet pages.
# It should be your IRC Network user account and not your 
# personal accounts. 
#        UserName = "somenet"

# This is your IRC Network User account password.
#        PassWord = "password"

# Leave the port at 2960 unless otherwise instructed.
#        Port = 2960

# This option handles how NeoNet connections are established. The available
# options are:
#	yes 	- Connect to NeoNet during startup
#	no 	- Never connect to NeoNet (Note, some features might not work if Connect
#	     	is set to No
#	demand 	- Only connect to NeoNet when there is a pending NeoNet Message
#	     	to be sent. 
	Connect = "no"
}
