These files are sample files that come from the RTA library that we use for
the postgresql emulation. 
They are only usefull to demonstrate what data is available via PHP for
inclusion into your website. 
To get them working, you should edit each file, and change the configuration
information contained near the top of the file (Such as pg_connect function,
with correct username/password information)

I'm looking for someone to write a PHP interface to NeoStats using this
information. If your interested, drop a note to devel@lists.neostats.net
about your plans, just to make sure that no one else is already working on
it.
