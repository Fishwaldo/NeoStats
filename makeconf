##################################################

##############################
# IRCd Linking Configuration #
##############################

# PROTOCOL <protocol> [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the protocol module to use.
#    Valid protocol options are:
#          bahamut client hybrid7 ircup10 
#          liquid mystic neoircd quantum 
#          ultimate2 ultimate3 unreal31 unreal32 
#          viagra
#
#          PROTOCOL "unreal32"
#      

#PROTOCOL "unreal32"

# DBM <dbm> [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the database manager module to use.
#    Valid options are:
#          gdbm
#
#          PROTOCOL "gdbm"
#      

PROTOCOL "gdbm"

# SERVER_NAME <hostname> [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the name of the NeoStats Server as it will appear on 
#    the network. e.g. 
#      
#          SERVER_NAME stats.neostats.net        
#      
#    When NeoStats links, it will appear as stats.neostats.net.

SERVER_NAME $SERVNAME

# SERVER_PORT <port number> [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the port to connect to on the IRC Server e.g.
#    
#        SERVER_PORT 6667        
#    
#    When connecting, NeoStats will connect to port 6667

SERVER_PORT $LINKPORT

# CONNECT_TO <ip address> [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the IP address to connect to. e.g.
#        
#        CONNECT_TO 127.0.0.1    
#    
#    This will force stats to connect to 127.0.0.1

CONNECT_TO $LINKSERVER

# CONNECT_PASS <link password> [REQUIRED]
#    Specifies the password used to connect. This must match your C/N 
#    lines in your IRCD configuration e.g.
#  
#      CONNECT_PASS linkpass    
#      
#    Send "linkpass" as the password to connect

CONNECT_PASS $LINKPASS

# SERVER_INFOLINE <info line> [REQUIRED]
#    Specify the description of the server that
#    appears when you do /links e.g.
#    
#        SERVER_INFOLINE Network Auxiliary Services    

SERVER_INFOLINE "$COMMENT"

# SERVER_NUMERIC <numeric> [RECOMMENDED]
#    Specify the numeric of the server to send on connect.
#    This must be a value between 1 and 254, and must not be in use by
#    any other IRC server on the network.  
#    Currently only Unreal IRCd uses this option.
#    
#        SERVER_NUMERIC 1

SERVER_NUMERIC "$SERVNUMERIC"

##########################
# NeoStats Configuration #
##########################

# SERVICES_CHAN #<channel name> [REQUIRED]
#    Specify the channel that all bots on NeoStats
#    will automatically join, and echo out any
#    important information e.g.
#    
#        SERVICES_CHAN #services    
#        
#    Makes NeoStats, and all the other bots join #services channel on 
#    start-up/load.

SERVICES_CHAN $NEOCHAN

# NO_LOAD [YOU MUST REMOVE THIS]
#    If this is in the neostats.conf your NeoStats WILL NOT START UP. To 
#    disable this simply comment this line out. e.g.
#        
#        NO_LOAD  <- NeoStats will not load.
#        
#        #NO_LOAD <- NeoStats will load.

NO_LOAD

# WANT_PRIVMSG [DISCOURAGED]
#    Specify if the bots should send all messages as privmsgs or as 
#    notices (Most Services use notice) e.g.
#     
#        WANT_PRIVMSG    
#    
#    If present, will send all messages as privmsgs (if commented out, 
#    it will send as Notices) *NOTE:* This option Violates IRC RFC, and 
#    can cause flooding problems on your network. Its NOT recommended. 

#WANT_PRIVMSG

# RECONNECT_TIME <seconds> [RECOMMENDED]
#    If NeoStats server gets split from the network, how long to wait 
#    before attempting to reconnect to the network. A value of 0 will 
#    cause NeoStats to shutdown and not attempt to reconnect. e.g.
#    
#        RECONNECT_TIME 10    
#    
#    Specifies wait 10 seconds before trying to reconnect
#        
#        RECONNECT_TIME 0
#    
#    Tells NeoStats to never reconnect to the network
#    
#    If not specified, NeoStats will default to 10 seconds.

RECONNECT_TIME $NEOCONN

# ONLY_OPERS [OPTIONAL]
#    Restrict NeoStats and StatServ to opers use only.
#    If not specified, users will have some access to NeoStats
#    and StatServ commands. e.g.
#    
#        ONLY_OPERS 
#        
#    Only opers may use NeoStats and StatServ.

#ONLY_OPERS

# BIND_TO [OPTIONAL]
#    Make NeoStats bind to a particular IP Address. If not
#    specified NeoStats will attempt to find this address
#    itself. e.g. 
#    
#        BIND_TO 203.203.123.12
#    
#    All outgoing connections from NeoStats will originate from this 
#    IP address
#    This IP address should not be localhost (127.0.0.1)

#BIND_TO $BINDIP

# LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT <format> [OPTIONAL]
#    Defines the format for dated log files. This allows you to choose 
#    what date format is used for log file names when they are rotated at 
#    midnight. The option uses the parameters passed to strftime so you 
#    can use any options valid for that function. Common ones are:
#        %a  Abbreviated weekday name 
#        %A  Full weekday name 
#        %b  Abbreviated month name 
#        %B  Full month name 
#        %d  Day of month as decimal number (01 – 31) 
#        %m  Month as decimal number (01 – 12) 
#        %y  Year without century, as decimal number (00 – 99) 
#        %Y  Year with century, as decimal number 
#
#    Examples using 30 September 2003 as the date:
#    For NeoStats0930.log:
#        
#        LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT %m%d
#    
#    For NeoStats20030930.log:
#    
#        LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT %Y%m%d      
#    
#    If not defined, the default is the original NeoStats log format of
#    "-%m-%d" i.e. NeoStats-09-30.log

#LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT $LOGFNAMEFORMAT

# SET_SERVER_TIMES <INTERVAL> [OPTIONAL]
#    Cause NeoStats to sync server times at the given interval
#    INTERVAL is an integer representing the number of hours
#        
#    Examples
#        
#        SET_SERVER_TIMES 24
#    
#    Cause NeoStats to sync server times every 24 hours
#    If not present, NeoStats will not sync times.
#    This option only works on Unreal servers and defaults to 
#    a sync interval of 24 hours. Enabling this option will also
#    cause NeoStats to sync servers when it first joins the 
#    network.

SET_SERVER_TIMES 24

#####################################
# Module Configurations and Loading #
#####################################

# LOAD_MODULE <module name> [OPTIONAL]
#    What modules to load at start-up. e.g. 
#        
#        LOAD_MODULE statserv
#    
#    Will load up StatServ at boot
#    
#    Multiple instances of LOAD_MODULE may be specified 

# StatServ, maintain and report various networks statistics
#LOAD_MODULE statserv

# LoveServ, send a rose, hug, kiss, etc to that special IRC somebody
#LOAD_MODULE loveserv

# HostServ, vhost services for users
#LOAD_MODULE hostserv

# MoraleServ, fun module to cheer people up.
#LOAD_MODULE moraleserv

# ConnectServ, monitor connections to the network: user connections, oper 
# modes, server connections and nick changes.
#LOAD_MODULE connectserv

# IRCdauth, authenticate users based on their user modes.
#LOAD_MODULE ircdauth

# Extauth, authenticate users based on nick!user@host access lists
#LOAD_MODULE extauth

########################################
# NeoStats ROOT user                   #
########################################

#SERVICE_ROOT <nick!user@host> [REQUIRED]
#    Set who should get master access to manage NeoStats regardless of 
#    authentication systems. Only one entry allowed. e.g.
#    
#        SERVICE_ROOT fish!?Fish@*.neostats.net
#        
#    Will give "fish" complete access to NeoStats if fish has 
#    umode +r and comes from the specified hostname and ident.
