* NeoStats * Shmad & Fish * Version 2.5.2
==============================================================================
Important Changes you should know: (READ THIS!)
==============================================================================
RedHat 9.0 Users:
	There have been some changes to the RedHat 9 Kernel that affects
	NeoStats. If you are running RedHat 9.0 please read
	http://www.neostats.net/boards/viewtopic.php?t=391

Configuration File:
	A lot of the options in the configuration file neostats.cfg are no
	longer used. Most of the configuration information for modules has 
	moved into a new Config Backend. Look at the help screens for Modules 
	like StatServ, HostServ, ConnectServ etc. You might also want to read
	README.kptool in the tools directory

Config Tools:
	Two new tools are provided to help you manage your Configuration
	files. kptool and configtool. kptool is a command line tool, Read
	README.kptool. ConfigTool is a GTK program, if you have Xwindows,
	configure with --enable-configtool and read 
	tools/cfgtool/README.configtool

Logging Changes:
	We have implemented a new Logging backend that should be quicker for
	busy networks. One feature of this new logging, is that you now have 
	some control over what type of information gets logged. There are 10 
	levels of logging, with 10 being for the insane, and 1 being for only 
	very critical errors, and 5 being the standard level of logging. You 
	can change the level of logging when you start up NeoStats by typing 
	"./neostats -d <1-10>" This means you don't have to recompile to
	enable debug support if we request it.

recv.log support:
	recv.log is a debugging option that enables the developers to get a
	copy of exactly what communications took place between the IRCd and 
	NeoStats when we are debuging problems. You can now enable recv.log 
	on the command line by specifying "./neostats -r"

CommandLine options:
	Several Commandline options are now available to help you control
	the way that NeoStats starts up. Type "./neostats -h" for a list.

3rd Party Modules:
	All 3rd Party Modules (Those not included with this Distribution,
	such as opsb or StupidServ) need to be recompiled. If your a 3rd 
	Party Module Author, you should be aware that you need to change 
	your module to use nlog now, instead of log
