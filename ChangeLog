NeoStats ChangeLog 
Anything we add/remove/fix/change is in here (even our rants)
===============================================================================
* NeoStats * Fish (F) & Mark (M) * Version 3.0.genesis
 - Module support calls to access timers/bots/sockets etc must now pass 
   correctly typed function pointers rather than using core symbol lookups (M)
 - dl.c/h split into files dedicated to a part of the module sytstem e.g. 
   bots.c. dl.c/h now becomes our wrapper library for handling libdl plus 
   future DLL and static support (M)
 - Added some extra fields to channel, user and server structures for future 
   use (M)
 - Point of no return. Legacy 2.5 systems are now broken. Some 2.5.15 compliant 
   systems will still work but all module backward compatibility has been 
   stripped. 
 - All core module changelogs move to docs/old. Future core module updates will
   be included in the main NeoStats changelog (M)
 - Remove module API hacks (M)
 - Remove legacy stats.h, API is now exported via neostats.h only (M)
 - Depreciate support for __module_functions and associated ModuleFunction 
   overheads,  version 3.0 will send information to modules via events only (M)
 - Remove 2.5.5 and lower module compatibility systems (M)
 - New source tree layout implemented (M)
 - Begin version 3.0 development (M)
