fnmatch is Baaaad news... find a good ircmatch function and port it over... 

unkline on Hybrid7

vhost code in NeoIRCd needs to be implemented for bots that are +x

I'm using old Ultimate2, need to check with current version

2.6.0 Series - 
------------

Re-Do the send/recv code... Its Horrible.. (Backup Server links etc can
then be implemented)

Move all the stuff in ircd.c into relevent ircd support files. ircd.c is
getting just way to hard to manage now and will get worse as
we add aditional IRCd support.

Redo Config files. I pretty much got Bison/Flex figured out... 

libwebserver module :)

make NeoStats Bot commands list based, so it can be extended via other
modules

DCC chat interface???

Language File support

do some nice cleanups of code in do_exit...
