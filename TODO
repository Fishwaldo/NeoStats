NeoStats - TODO Log:
--------------------


Shmad:
------

- Fix crash on split rejoin some people experience 
- Fix netname not being passed correctly fx: Chaos-Networks gets passed to Ultimate2 as Chaos for some reason. 
- Fix neo segfaulting if a moron kills it with /kill <- This doesnt replicate for me at all. :P



HostServ TODO:
--------------

- make CHPASSWD.  In order for a user to change a password their nick, host and password all have to match.
  This is how we get around just anyone changing passwords to "GROUP" vhosts.
Syntax: /msg HostServ CHPASS NICK OLDPASS NEWPASS
