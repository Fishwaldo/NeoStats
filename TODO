NeoStats - TODO Log:
--------------------

* Once we do these they are removed from the list

 - Support HTML writeouts for the "networks" website. 
 - Support SUSPEND - suspends an oper's access from Stats 
 - FIX some RAWs segfaulting the server.. they really shouldnt
 - FIX /msg NeoStats UPTIME segfaulting the server. Use /stats u stats.*
   istead for the time being
 - FIX SIGHUP segfaulting *sigh*
 - Add rehash(); code.. theres nothing in it
 - fix mem consumption, it still does it but not as bad!
 - Updated Documentation. It should be current, but not quite idiot proof
   yet... this has been proven unfortunately.
 - Finish HostServ and LogServ.
