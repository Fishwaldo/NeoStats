NeoStats - TODO Log:

UserLvl sucks.... comput it only once, and store it in the users struct.
Only re-compute when they change nick (if extauth is compiled), or
change modes (in fact, u can move the stuff into the umode function,
save u 3x a table lookup)

fnmatch is Baaaad news... find a good ircmatch function and port it over... 

join 0 is really broken atm :)

"make dist" option. 

SMODE command from Ultimate3 (needs to be done asap)

2.6.0 Series - Yep, I'm already thinking about this....
------------

Channel (Not IRC Channels, Event Channels)  Based Logging... Means we can get rid of the #ifdef DEBUG, log(... 
stuff, and define what gets logged when.

Module Config File Support improvements. (I got ideas - Find Keeper Config libary for more info:)

Re-Do the send/recv code... Its Horrible.. (Backup Server links etc can
then be implemented)

Move all the stuff in ircd.c into relevent ircd support files. ircd.c is
getting just way to hard to manage now and will get worse as
we add aditional IRCd support.

"Driver" modules??? (eg, Unreal, Ultimate are drivers. So is DB/SQL
or WebServer)

Redo Config files. I pretty much got Bison/Flex figured out... 

libwebserver module :)

make NeoStats Bot commands list based, so it can be extended via other
modules

DCC chat interface???

Language File support
