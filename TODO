HostServ TODO:
--------------

- make CHPASSWD.  In order for a user to change a password their nick, host and password all have to match.
  This is how we get around just anyone changing passwords to "GROUP" vhosts.
Syntax: /msg HostServ CHPASS NICK OLDPASS NEWPASS

UserLvl sucks.... comput it only once, and store it in the users struct.
Only re-compute when they change nick (if extauth is compiled), or
change modes (in fact, u can move the stuff into the umode function,
save u 3x a table lookup)

fnmatch is Baaaad news... find a good ircmatch function and port it over... 


2.6.0 Series - Yep, I'm already thinking about this....
------------

Channel Based Logging... Means we can get rid of the #ifdef DEBUG, log(... 
stuff, and define what gets logged when.

Module Config File Support improvements. (I got ideas :)

Re-Do the send/recv code... Its Horrible..
