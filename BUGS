Bug Lists that I've found, but not started working on:
======================================================
When a module is unloaded (by say, segv) when you attempt to 
Load the module again, it *seems* that none of the modbotlist entries,
or modtimerlist entries do not work. 
(to reproduct: crash a module and reload it. /msg neostats modbotlist does
not show the reloaded module) (Could be due to
hash code, which I'm doing right now 28.2.2002)

User/Bot code is Case sensitive at the moment.
eg, finduser, findbot so on are case sensitive. Have to fix this up :)
