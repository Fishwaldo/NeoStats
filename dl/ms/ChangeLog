  - Slight typo in the "User Not Found" message corrected.
  - "Channel Not Found" Code added (main use in the MSG routine... although used in
    other parts of the code)
  - Minimum access 180 raised to 185 (NA level) nfi what I was thinking when I dropped
    it to 180 ;p
  - Realised not all routines had the seggie code. All routines now have it
  - Some older code indented... looks purdy now :P
  - NA/TA requirement moved to first minimum requirement for the "special" commands

* MoraleServ * ^Enigma^ * Version Increment -> 2.14
  - In line with LoveServ the "User Not Found" Patch was added
  - Proper Stats.* host name now ;o) (-x)

* MoraleServ * ^Enigma^ * Version Increment -> 2.13
  - Many little things changed for "standard" release.

* MoraleServ * ^Enigma^ * Version Increment -> 2.12
 - MoraleServ Echos unknown topics (in full) to the Services chan - JB's idea (odd little man)
 - MoraleServ no longer a "Test Code" service.

* MoraleServ * ^Enigma^ * Version Increment -> 2.1
 - Changed 185->190 "TechAdmin-Ship" sounds much nicer than "NetAdmin-Ship"... plus I'm a TA,
   not a NA :P~~~~
 - Changed 190->185 @ request of shmad. This is a sad day in irc. Lets take a little moment to
   remember when only the "clever" people could screw the system with raw commands shall we?
 - Decision made about Version 2.5 -> will no longer be a "Test Code Service". Renaming of
   NigglesServ to MoraleServ on the agenda but may not happen will V3.0
 - printfile & unlinkfile added to code... no HELP menu docuementation... too evil for that ;p
   (Although commands are documented through "HELP PRINTFILE" & "HELP UNLINKFILE")
   # printfile can open and print any file via PRIVMSG/NOTICE. God I'd hate to be the poor bastard
   who tries to dump a couple thousand lines lmao. Originaly designed to create a backup of 
   "hostserv.c" on a shell without ftpd (there is proof that Shmad & Me are REALLY coding it! :P)
 - LOAD & UNLOAD of module now recorded in the log. Useful for uptime calculation (cept for
   seggies) prolly won't go much further than this lmao.
 - Overhauls to the entire LOG system. Backup and reset offered. LOGS renamed to VIEWLOG
 - MSG command changed due to a little abuse problem. Non-Access list people now have a 
   "(MSG issued by xxx)" added to thier MSG command. Hopefully this will deter. Access-Users don't
   get the attachment ;p
 - Fixed the "root access denied" for 'normal users' requesting HELP 
 - Added new feature - "WONDERFUL"... sings a little song, makes the user feel special

Log Started (V2.0.11)

* Prelim information:
MoraleServ orginally started off as something other than the service it is today. Over time, 
MoraleServ grew into a some what popular "play service". New fuctions were added, both good 
and evil ;p Version 2.0 saw an increase in the use due to the features and 2.0.11 offered some 
advanced techie features. 2.0.11 was then renamed to MoraleServ and the "Test Code" was dropped
to become the stable 2.1
