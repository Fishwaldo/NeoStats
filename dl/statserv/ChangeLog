* Version 3.6 * March 28th, 2003 (F)

* Version 3.5 * December 13th, 2002 (F)
 - StatServ now has the option to only wallop 5 records broken in a particular timeframe.
	eg, 5 wallops per 5 minutes, any more, and statserv doesn't say a thing.
	set WALLOP_INTERVAL in neostats.cfg to the interval time
 - Some Stats that we were collecting was never displayed, added it to the output and html display
 - DelOldChan was only deleting 1 chan per hour, and could delete chans that were older than 1 day, but still had members. Fixed. 
 - Fixed the ok_to_wallops stuff
 - Fixed up OperList

* Version 3.42 * September 3rd, 2002 (S)
 - Fixed make insall now copies the template too 
 - RESET now just tells you how to properly reset Server Statistics database.
 - Can ONLY delete stats if the server IS NOT Online.
 - Changed all levels from 190 to 185 since Unreal users just cant seem to install SR in any
   event Net/Tech are same level essentially. So internals for SS use 185 as highest level.
 - Fixed a bug with deloldchan timer where it would only delete one channel per hour! (F)

* Version 3.41 * July 29th, 2002 (S)
 - Fixed a bug where channel alerts would get dropped notice changed to chanalert()
 - Stopped walloping new records on new DB and when syncing to the network (not walloping on syncing only works in statserv is loaded via config file. If loaded via /msg neostats load, then it will yell. Tough. Load it via the config file!)

* Version 3.4 * July 17th, 2002(F)
 - Ported to the new Module Event API
 - Fixed a bug with getting incorrect channel count and channel member count when loaded as a module after neo has already been running
 - Why the hell was statserv changing the u->is_away structure. StatServ doesn't and shouldn't do that. Fixed (maybe fixes crazy away count bug?)

 - added tldmap to statserv output
 - fixed htmlstats to write out straight away, instead of buffer, this fixed overflow problems and random crashes on large networks
