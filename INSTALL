Congratulations on Downloading NeoStats, one of the more powerful and 
robust IRC Statistical programs on the market.  This Configuration Manual
will get you started using NeoStats.  If you have any questions that I
have not addressed in this manual, please feel free to visit /server
irc.neostats.net and join #NeoStats and ask your qiestion.  If no one seems
to be around you can memo Shmad with your question(s) and email address and
we will get back to you as soon as we can.




[1] Getting Started.

First off, you're going to want to uncompress NeoStats to do this type the following:

tar xvfz NeoStats2.0.tar.gz (this may vary depending on the version you run of Neo
                             change the NeoStats2.0.tar.gz to match your filename )

** Note: For some systems that don't run a new version of tar you may have to do this:
         gzip -d NeoStats2.0.tar.gz
         tar xvf NeoStats2.0.tar




[2] Running configure

Wow it worked! We should now have a directory called NeoStats-2.0.11
Now type:

cd NeoStats2.0.11

Your prompt should look something similar to:
[shmad@coderz NeoStats2.0.11]

Now Type:
./configure (this is CASE sensitive guys remember that -- everything is)

ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you use UnrealIRCd use --enable-unreal
			    Ultimate use   --enable-ultimate
			    Ultimate3 use  --enable-ultimate3


Now the script will check to see if all necessary programs to run NeoStats
are installed on your system. A small note here, for those of you who have
emailed me paranoid, NeoStats DOES NOT check your back account balance, 
nor can it.




[3] Compiling NeoStats

Ok, you should now be back at a shell prompt, now type:

make

it will go through the source and compile it into an executable binary file.
If you get some warnings, please ignore them -- we are working on the warnings.




[4] Setting up the stats.cfg file

Type:

./makeconf

This will take you through the stats.cfg creator.  it is recommended after
running makeconf to check the stats.cfg manually as well.
this can be done by typing:

pico stats.cfg

The 'stats.cfg' file is pretty self explainitory, if you have a question
please feel free to ask me.. Once you are done editting the file Press 
Ctrl-X then hit Y and enter to save the file.



[5] Compiling modules

Type:

cd dl
make

This will compile ALL the modules NeoStats can use.



[6] Editting niconfig.db (ONLY IF YOU WISH TO USE NetInfo)

Ok we're almost done this hard work will pay off :)

Type:

cd ~/NeoStats-2.0.11/data
pico niconfig.db (again CASE SenSiTiVe)

This file itself is pretty self explainitory as well.  Once you are done 
editting this file, press Ctrl-X then hit Y and enter to save the file.




[7] Running NeoStats

Ok, if everything else went fine, you are now read to run NeoStats.  To run 
NeoStats from the shell you have to type:

cd ~/NeoStats-2.0.11
./stats


It should link and sync with your server in a matter of seconds.

** Note: Make sure your server(S) have U: lines for your stats server.
**       Please Please Please! Remember to add the proper C & N lines
	 on your server as well!



** FINAL NOTICE ** ** FINAL NOTICE ** ** FINAL NOTICE ** ** FINAL NOTICE **
I WILL NOT ASSIST YOU WITH ADDING C: N: AND U: LINES TO YOUR SERVER, 
YOU SHOULD READ THE IRCd's DOCUMENTATION IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO IT!!!
