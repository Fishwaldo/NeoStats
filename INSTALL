This is a very brief INSTALL guide for setting up and using NeoStats,
the IRC Statistical Services.

NeoStats Website is at http://codeworks.kamserve.com

[1] Download NeoStats from our website.  If you have it skip to step 2

[2] uncompress the tarball, this can be accomplished by typing:
    tar xvfz NeoStats-1.1.2.tar.gz

[3] go into the directory and type "make" without the quotes, this will
    compile the software.

[4] edit the stats.cfg file, if you don't you won't be able to run NeoStats
    type: pico stats.cfg    or   joe stats.cfg whichever editor you like to use.

[5] Once you have finished editting the config file, you are ready to start NeoStats
    This is accomplished by typing "./stats" without the quotes.


It should connect with your IRC Server, BE SURE YOU'VE ADDED C/N LINES AND U: LINES ON THE SERVER TO
WHICH IT IS CONNECTING!!!
