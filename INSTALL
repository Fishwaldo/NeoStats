the IRC Statistical Services.

    tar xvfz NeoStats-2.0.tar.gz

[3] go into the NeoStats-2.0 Directory, and run ./configure. To Enable
    Specific Features, or other IRCD Support, type ./configure --help to get a
    list of Specific --enable-<options> that are available in this release

[4] type "make" without the quotes, this will compile the software.

[5] edit the stats.cfg file, if you don't you won't be able to run NeoStats
    type: pico stats.cfg    or   joe stats.cfg whichever editor you like to use.

[6] Once you have finished editting the config file, you are ready to start NeoStats
    This is accomplished by typing "./stats" without the quotes.
