NeoStats 2.0.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ok.. we are FINALLY out of beta :) w00t!


Module Status:
--------------
- StatServ now fully functional.
- Spam working like a dream.
- IcqServ works, but is still under heavy development :)
- Services havn't even been touched
- version is a simple example of writting a Module
- NetInfo is fully functional.

the module.txt file in the dl directory is a bit outdated. Use it for
reference only, but you want to find out more about the API (like specific
Function calls, etc) then look at the statserv module as it contains almost
all the Module API calls that are available. 

I've verified it works with Unreal 3.1.1 and higher, so there should be no
problems here. No one has come to us saying they want support for another
IRCD, so its still only Unreal.
it should work with Ultimate IRCD as well (based on Unreal and dreamforge)
it might work with Elite.

Bugs:
-----
Still a few lerking around in the code. I've been concentrating on the Icq
and Statserv modules of late, and have only been fixing bugs in the main
code as I find them. I havn't gone on a extensive Bug hunting mission
1. StatServ Daily commands are not correct
2. Other StatServ Statistics might be questionable :)


PLEASE send me those bug reports!
