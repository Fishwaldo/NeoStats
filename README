Thank you for downloading NeoStats. 

NeoStats is a powerful and extendable set of *services* for IRC. By 
Services, we do not mean NickServ/Chanserv etc but additional services. 
These additional services include things like StatServ which gives you 
statistics on the number of users/operators/channels/servers, and
MoraleServ, which is a *fun* module, to send funny messages to users, 
and utility modules. Some modules have a useful function on your 
network, other modules are developed for fun, and to make your IRC 
network more attractive to users.

The 3.0 series of NeoStats [blurb]

A detailed list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog file, but a 
brief summary is:

1. Installing and configuring NeoStats
--------------------------------------

This section explains how to install and configure NeoStats. We 
recommend that you read this section in full before trying to install 
NeoStats.

If you have any problems NOT addressed in this or other documents, 
please see the Support section for how to contact us for help.


1.1 General notes
-----------------

All commands and filenames are case sensitive. This means that 
NeoStats, neostats and NEOSTATS are all different things. When 
typing commands you should use the same case as provided in this 
file or things will not work correctly.


1.2 Getting Started
-------------------

First, you need to uncompress NeoStats. To do this type the following:

        tar xvfz NeoStats3.0.x.tar.gz 

This will vary depending on the version you run of NeoStats. Change the 
x in NeoStats3.0.x.tar.gz to match your filename e.g. 

        NeoStats3.0.0.tar.gz

For systems that don't run a new version of tar you need to do this:

        gzip -d NeoStats3.0.x.tar.gz
        tar xvf NeoStats3.0.x.tar

1.3 Running configure
---------------------

You must first run the configure script so that NeoStats can determine
your build environment.

To run configure, you must first change to the directory where you 
uncompressed NeoStats. e.g.

        cd ~/NeoStats3.0.0

Your prompt should look something like:
    
        [user@host NeoStats3.0.50]

Now type:
    
        ./configure
        
The configure script will then check to see if all necessary programs to 
run NeoStats are installed on your system. 

Optional settings:
------------------

There are some options you can pass to configure if you wish. 

Debugging:

Most users will never look at this option. It compiles NeoStats 
with debugging turned on. I would only suggest using this if you 
have problems and are about to fill out a bug form.

        --enable-debug        Enables Debugging

XWindows Configuration Tool:

To enable building of the configtool program (Needs X windows)

        --enable-configtool

Enabling RAW command:

We strongly recommend against the use of this option. Use of RAW 
commands can cause desync on your network and badly formatted commands 
can crash your network. If you do enable this option, we will not 
provide any support for your use of this command. Please do not contact 
us for support of the RAW command.

        --enable-raw 


1.4 Compiling NeoStats
----------------------

Ok, you should now be back at a shell prompt, type:

        make

it will go through the source and compile it into an executable 
binary file. If you get some warnings, please ignore them -- we are 
working on the warnings.


1.5 Installing NeoStats
-----------------------

If you are upgrading a working version of NeoStats. Please read section 
1.9 Notes for Upgraders now.

NeoStats must be "installed" into its own directory. By default NeoStats 
will install into ~/NeoStats3.0/ i.e. in your home directory e.g.

        /home/fish/NeoStats3.0/
    
If you wish to change the install location, please type 

		./configure --help
		
and follow the instructions on screen.

To install NeoStats type:

        make install

This will create the necessary files, and copy them to the 
installation directory. 


1.6 Setting up the neostats.conf file
-------------------------------------

Now you should change to the installation directory (~/NeoStats/, or 
whatever you specified in ./configure) e.g.

        cd ~/NeoStats3.0

Your prompt should look something like:
    
        [user@host NeoStats3.0]

Once in this directory, you need to create a configuration file. You
should now run the makeconf script and answer the questions:
    
        ./makeconf

You must edit neostats.conf to check that everything is set the way you 
want it before NeoStats will run. You can do this with:

        pico neostats.conf

All the options are described below and in the neostats.conf file. Once 
you are done editing the file save it. 

If using pico as in the previous example, press Ctrl-X then hit Y and 
enter to save the file.

NOTE: some additional modules have additional configuration options that 
must be specified in the neostats.conf file. Please see the documentation 
for the individual modules for any configuration options. 

The available options for the main NeoStats distribution are described
below. 

Each of the options has an indicator as follows:
    [REQUIRED]    - must be set or NeoStats will not run
    [RECOMMENDED] - optional but may cause problems if not set
    [OPTIONAL]    - optional and the feature will be disabled if not set
    [DISCOURAGED] - may cause undesirable side effects if enabled

IRCD Linking Configuration Options
----------------------------------

PROTOCOL <protocol> [REQUIRED]
    Specifies the protocol module to use.
    Valid protocol options are:
          bahamut client hybrid7 ircup10 
          liquid mystic neoircd quantum 
          ultimate2 ultimate3 unreal31 unreal32 
          viagra
    e.g.
          PROTOCOL "unreal32"
      

SERVER_NAME <hostname> [REQUIRED]
    Specifies the name of the NeoStats Server as it will appear on 
    the network. e.g. 
      
          SERVER_NAME stats.neostats.net        
      
    When NeoStats links, it will appear as stats.neostats.net.

SERVER_PORT <port number> [REQUIRED]
    Specifies the port to connect to on the IRC Server e.g.
    
        SERVER_PORT 6667        
    
    When connecting, NeoStats will connect to port 6667

CONNECT_TO <ip address> [REQUIRED]
    Specifies the IP address to connect to. e.g.
        
        CONNECT_TO 127.0.0.1    
    
    This will force stats to connect to 127.0.0.1

CONNECT_PASS <link password> [REQUIRED]
    Specifies the password used to connect. This must match your C/N 
    lines in your IRCD configuration e.g.
  
      CONNECT_PASS linkpass    
      
    Send "linkpass" as the password to connect
    
SERVER_INFOLINE <info line> [REQUIRED]
    Specify the description of the server that
    appears when you do /links e.g.
    
        SERVER_INFOLINE Network Auxiliary Services    
    
SERVER_NUMERIC <numeric> [RECOMMENDED]
    Specify the numeric of the server to send on connect.
    This must be a value between 1 and 254, and must not be in use by
    any other IRC server on the network.  
    Currently only Unreal IRCd uses this option.
    
        SERVER_NUMERIC 1

NeoStats Configuration options
------------------------------
    
SERVICES_CHAN #<channel name> [REQUIRED]
    Specify the channel that all bots on NeoStats
    will automatically join, and echo out any
    important information e.g.
    
        SERVICES_CHAN #services    
        
    Makes NeoStats, and all the other bots join #services channel on 
    start-up/load.

NO_LOAD [YOU MUST REMOVE THIS]
    If this is in the neostats.conf your NeoStats WILL NOT START UP. To 
    disable this simply comment this line out. e.g.
        
        NO_LOAD  <- NeoStats will not load.
        
        #NO_LOAD <- NeoStats will load.
    
WANT_PRIVMSG [NOT RECOMMENDED]
    Specify if the bots should send all messages as privmsgs or as 
    notices (Most Services use notice) e.g.
     
        WANT_PRIVMSG    
    
    If present, will send all messages as privmsgs (if commented out, 
    it will send as Notices) *NOTE:* This option Violates IRC RFC, and 
    can cause flooding problems on your network. Its NOT recommended. 
    
RECONNECT_TIME <seconds> [RECOMMENDED]
    If NeoStats server gets split from the network, how long to wait 
    before attempting to reconnect to the network. A value of 0 will 
    cause NeoStats to shutdown and not attempt to reconnect. e.g.
    
        RECONNECT_TIME 10    
    
    Specifies wait 10 seconds before trying to reconnect
        
        RECONNECT_TIME 0
    
    Tells NeoStats to never reconnect to the network
    
    If not specified, NeoStats will default to 10 seconds.
    
ONLY_OPERS [OPTIONAL]
    Restrict NeoStats and StatServ to opers use only.
    If not specified, users will have some access to NeoStats
    and StatServ commands. e.g.
    
        ONLY_OPERS 
        
    Only opers may use NeoStats and StatServ.
    
BIND_TO [OPTIONAL]
    Make NeoStats bind to a particular IP Address. If not
    specified NeoStats will attempt to find this address
    itself. e.g. 
    
        BIND_TO 203.203.123.12
    
    All outgoing connections from NeoStats will originate from this 
    IP address. 
    
LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT <format> [OPTIONAL]
    Defines the format for dated log files. This allows you to choose 
    what date format is used for log file names when they are rotated at 
    midnight. The option uses the parameters passed to strftime so you 
    can use any options valid for that function. Common ones are:
        %a  Abbreviated weekday name 
        %A  Full weekday name 
        %b  Abbreviated month name 
        %B  Full month name 
        %d  Day of month as decimal number (01 – 31) 
        %m  Month as decimal number (01 – 12) 
        %y  Year without century, as decimal number (00 – 99) 
        %Y  Year with century, as decimal number 

    Examples using 30 September 2003 as the date:
    For NeoStats0930.log:
        
        LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT %m%d
    
    For NeoStats20030930.log:
    
        LOG_FILENAME_FORMAT %Y%m%d      
    
    If not defined, default is "-%m-%d" i.e. NeoStats-09-30.log

SET_SERVER_TIMES <INTERVAL> [OPTIONAL]
    Cause NeoStats to sync server times at the given interval
    INTERVAL is an integer representing the number of hours
        
    Examples
        
        SET_SERVER_TIMES 24
    
    Cause NeoStats to sync server times every 24 hours
    If not present, NeoStats will not sync times.
    This option only works on Unreal servers and defaults to 
    a sync interval of 24 hours. Enabling this option will also
    cause NeoStats to sync servers when it first joins the 
    network.

Module Configuration Options
----------------------------
    
LOAD_MODULE <module name> [OPTIONAL]
    what module to load at start-up. e.g. 
        
        LOAD_MODULE statserv
    
    Will load up StatServ at boot
    
    Multiple instances of LOAD_MODULE may be specified 


NeoStats Root user
------------------
    
SERVICE_ROOT <nick!user@host> [REQUIRED]
    Set who should get master access to manage NeoStats regardless of 
    authentication systems. Only one entry allowed. e.g.
    
        SERVICE_ROOT fish!?Fish@*.neostats.net
        
    Will give "fish" complete access to NeoStats if fish has 
    umode +r and comes from the specified hostname and ident. 

1.7 Compiling additional modules
--------------------------------

If you have downloaded other NeoStats modules e.g. OPSB, you should now 
install them. If you are upgrading NeoStats, you must rebuild all other 
separate modules to work with the new version of NeoStats. See the 
documentation with these modules for instructions on building and 
installing them. Modules written for previous series of NeoStats will
not work with the 3.0 series. You must contact the module author for an
updated version of the module.

1.8 Running NeoStats
--------------------

NeoStats is now configured and installed. 

Before running NeoStats you must make sure that your server(s) have C: 
N: and U: lines for your NeoStats server. 
I WILL NOT ASSIST YOU WITH ADDING C: N: AND U: LINES TO YOUR SERVER, 
YOU SHOULD READ THE IRCD DOCUMENTATION IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO 
IT!!! DO NOT CONTACT US ABOUT C: N: and U: Lines

Once your C/N/U lines are setup, you need to start NeoStats. You should 
change to the directory where NeoStats in installed e.g.

        cd ~/NeoStats3.0

Then to run NeoStats type:

        ./neostats

It should link and sync with your server in a matter of seconds.

Please now read USERMAN for details on how to operate NeoStats from an 
IRC Client.

If anything goes wrong, there *might* be an error message in the log 
files. Have a look in ~/NeoStats/logs/NeoStats.log it might give you a 
clue to what's wrong! NeoStats might also send a wallops to the network 
about what went wrong. Check the status window of your IRC client. 

There are some command line options for NeoStats that you may find
useful:

    -h        will display a help screen showing these options.
    -v        will display the version number
    -r        Enable recv.log
    -d 1-10   Enable debugging output 1= lowest, 10 = highest
    -n        Do not load any modules on startup
    -q        Quiet start - for cron scripts
    -f        Do not fork into background (for debugging)

To use these options, add the option(s) you require when you run 
NeoStats, e.g.:

	./neostats -h
	
Note: although you can combine most of these options, -v (version)
and -h (help) will return information to you and NeoStats will not
process any other options you pass. 	


1.9 Notes for upgraders
-----------------------

If you are upgrading from an older version we recommend that you backup 
the current version first. 

If you are running crontab for NeoStats, we recommend that you disable 
this before making the upgrade so that cron does not start up an older
versopn while you are working on the upgrade. 

Make sure that NeoStats is not running. In an IRC client connected to 
your network type:

        /msg NeoStats shutdown Upgrade

NeoStats will save important information so wait for this to finish. 

To make the backup go to your home directory and type:

        cp NeoStats NeoStatsBackup -r

If you fail to perform this backup and the upgrade causes you problems, 
you might lose all NeoStats information. 

We also recommend rebuilding any additional modules after upgrading
NeoStats. You may not need to upgrade the additional module, just 
rebuild and reinstall it after the make install in Step 1.4 above.

If after upgrading, NeoStats crashes when loading one of your modules 
e.g. OPSB, this usually means that you did not rebuild the module for 
the latest version of NeoStats. 

If you do run into problems upgrading and need to restore your backup, 
you can do so by going to your home directory and typing:

        cp NeoStatsBackup NeoStats -r

Your old modules will also be restored along with the old version of
NeoStats so there is no need to rebuild them for a restore. 


-----------------------------------<>-----------------------------------

2 Support Information
---------------------

2.1 Before contacting support
-----------------------------

** IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING US **

In order that we can dedicate time to developing NeoStats and can address 
support issues quickly, there are some ways you can help to reduce 
unnecessary support calls to the NeoStats team. 

First, check you are using the latest release version of NeoStats as found on 
the NeoStats download page. It could be that your problem is fixed or your 
suggestion implemented in the latest version. We are not able to provide 
support for older versions of NeoStats than the current release. 

We provide no support for SVN snapshots whether released on the web site or 
not. If you have downloaded a SVN snapshot and are having problems, you should 
revert back to your previous working version or if this is your first 
installation, the current release build as indicated on the web site. Please 
do not contact us about problems with SVN versions. We will advise users 
occasionally to try a SVN snapshot to fix a problem, but as we do not put our 
SVN versions through extensive testing, there might be new bugs or problems. 

We may occasionally provide a custom modification to resolve a problem. Other 
than in this event, we provide no support for modified versions of NeoStats. 
If you have modified NeoStats in any way and experience problems, you should 
only contact us if you can reproduce the problem with an unmodified version. 
We are not able to support modifications to NeoStats made by others. 

Before contacting us with a problem or a bug, please make sure you have read 
all the documentation provided. You should then check the web site bug list 
and search the forums to see if your problem has already been reported and if 
a solution has been posted. 

Before sending us a suggestion, you should check the forums carefully to see 
if your suggestion has already been made and if the NeoStats team have decided 
to implement it or not. 

You do not have to read all the messages to find out if your issue has 
already been discussed. The use of the "Search" feature on the forums is a 
great way to quickly get answers to your problem if other users have already 
encountered the issue. 

NeoStats Group are only able to help with issues affecting NeoStats. We are 
not able to help set up your IRC Server or Services on your network (including 
the setup of C: N: and U: lines) so please don't ask us. If you have a 
question about your IRC Server or Services package, please check the 
documentation that came with them and contact their team if you still need 
assistance. 

The RAW command is an unsupported command. If you need help using it, you 
should probably not be using it. Please do not ask us for help on the RAW 
command.

Thank you. 


2.1 Where to get support
------------------------

You can get support for NeoStats in a number of different ways so choose
the one that suits you best.

* Bug reporting system
A new bug reporting section has been introduced and you can check this  
to see if there are any known bugs in NeoStats and find out when they 
are fixed. Soon you will be able to report bugs using this system. 
For the bug tracking system, visit:

        http://bugs.neostats.net/index.php 

* Message boards available at:

        http://www.neostats.net/boards/

* The NeoStats IRC support channel at:

        server:  irc.irc-chat.net 
        channel: #neostats

Be warned that we are not always available on the channel to help you. 
There is a bot there called neoserv that contains the latest bugs and
support information (duplicated from the NeoStats board).

2.2 What to provide when requesting support
-------------------------------------------

It always helps to provide as much information as possible about your 
environment when asking for help. Please make sure you include at least 
the following information:
    
    Operating system version (i.e., Redhat 7.0, Mandrake 9.1 etc)
    gcc version (found via gcc -v)
    Version of NeoStats you are using and if the problem is with a 
    module, the version of the module (found via /msg neostats modlist)
    The type of IRCD you are attempting to connect to (and version 
    number)

We may request that you enable debugging and submit us the results of 
debugging. To enable Debugging, use the following command to start 
NeoStats:

        ./neostats -d 9 -r

When it crashes, or the bug has been reproduced, send us:
        
        logs/debug.log
        logs/recv.log (if it exists, You may wish to edit the first few 
        lines of the file to remove the link password)

This will help us to be able to reproduce the bug and create a fix for 
it.

-----------------------------------<>-----------------------------------

3. Contributions
----------------

Want to Help us? 

We are always looking for help.

Currently, what we really are looking for is people to help us out with 
translating our documentation and of course, other people that can code 
in C to help us with development.

We hope to shortly provide a Module Programmers Guide to help those 
people out there take advantage of NeoStats and write their own 
extensions (or Modules) for NeoStats.

If you would like to help out, See Support Information above for details 
on how to contact us.
