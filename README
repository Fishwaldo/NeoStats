NeoStats 2.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation:
-------------
The configure script has been changed compared to the old 2.0.x 
releases and you must now make sure you supply the right arguments
to configure.

What is required:
-----------------
IRCD Support:
	To specify the IRCD you are compiling for. eg:
	--enable-unreal		for UnrealIRCD
	--enable-ultimate 	for UltimateIRCD

What is optional:
-----------------
Privledge System:
	Originally, NeoStats was based on Operator Flags on a network.
	If you had TechAdmin on Unreal, you were basically allowed full control to
	Neostats. Now though, you can enable what is called External
	Authentication. This allows different ways of the NeoStats Privledge system.
	The Currently available options are:
	--enable-auth=sr 	This Enables a ServiceRoots option, which a user must be identified to services 
				(with the +r flag) and they will have full access to NeoStats.
	Default is IRCD		This reverts back to the old
				NeoStats Privledge system, where Authenication is based on the users flags
				(+oOANs etc etc)

Modules Support:
	NeoStats has a expanding set of modules. Some Modules have their own --enable options, while other modules do not.
	The Current Modules that can be enabled directly include:
	--enable-statserv 	Enables the statserv module
	--enable-spam		Enables the Spam Module
	--enable-icq		Enables the ICQ Module (Work in progress)
	--enable-version	A API Example. No practical use on a network.
	--enable-netinfo	Enable the Netinfo Module
	--enable-services	Enable Services
	--enable-loveserv	Enables LoveServ

	NeoStats also comes with many additional Modules, and many more can be downloaded from out site. A example is the scriptserv module
	To enable a module at compile time (or multiple modules) use the following option:
	--enable-modules="scriptserv cs"
	
	Defaults are StatServ and Spam

Debuging:
	Most users will never look at this option. It compiles NeoStats
	with debuging turned on. I would only suggest using this if you have
	problems are are about to fill out a bug form.
	--enable-debug		Enables Debugging




Module Status:
--------------
- StatServ now fully functional.
- Spam working like a dream.
- IcqServ works, but is still under heavy development :)
- Services havn't even been touched
- version is a simple example of writting a Module
- NetInfo is fully functional.

the module.txt file in the dl directory is a bit outdated. Use it for
reference only, but you want to find out more about the API (like specific
Function calls, etc) then look at the statserv module as it contains almost
all the Module API calls that are available. 

I've verified it works with Unreal 3.1.1 and higher, so there should be no
problems here. No one has come to us saying they want support for another
IRCD, so its still only Unreal.
it should work with Ultimate IRCD as well (based on Unreal and dreamforge)
it might work with Elite.

Bugs:
-----
Still a few lerking around in the code. I've been concentrating on the Icq
and Statserv modules of late, and have only been fixing bugs in the main
code as I find them. I havn't gone on a extensive Bug hunting mission
1. StatServ Daily commands are not correct
2. Other StatServ Statistics might be questionable :)


PLEASE send me those bug reports!
