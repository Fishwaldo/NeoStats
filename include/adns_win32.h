 *  For the benefit of certain LGPL'd `omnibus' software which provides

 *  adns-using part to be distributed separately.
 *  
 *  So, you may also redistribute and/or modify adns.h (but only the

 *  Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at
 *  your option) any later version.
 *  
 *  Note that adns itself is GPL'd.  Authors of adns-using applications
 *  with GPL-incompatible licences, and people who distribute adns with
 *  applications where the whole distribution is not GPL'd, are still
 *  likely to be in violation of the GPL.  Anyone who wants to do this
 *  should contact Ian Jackson.  Please note that to avoid encouraging
 *  people to infringe the GPL as it applies the body of adns, Ian thinks
 *  that if you take advantage of the special exception to redistribute
 *  just adns.h under the LGPL, you should retain this paragraph in its
 *  place in the appropriate copyright statements.
