#Here's a little song I wrote, You might want to sing it note for note
#Don't Worry - Be Happy
#In every life we have some trouble, But when you worry you make it Double
#Don't Worry - Be Happy, Don't Worry - Be Happy now
#Don't Worry - Be Happy, Don't Worry - Be Happy
#Ain't got no place to lay your head, Somebody came and took your bed
#Don't Worry - Be Happy
#The landlord say your rent is late, He may have to litigate
#Don't Worry - Be Happy, Look at Me - I'm Happy
#Don't Worry - Be Happy
#Here I give you my phone number, When you worry call me, I make you happy
#Don't Worry - Be Happy
#Ain't got not cash, ain't got no style, Ain't got no gal to make you smile
#Don't Worry - Be Happy
#'Cause when you worry your face will frown, and that will bring everybody down
#Don't Worry - Be Happy, Don't Worry, Don't Worry - Don't do it
#Be Happy - Put a smile on your face, Don't bring everybody down
#Don't Worry, it will soon pass, whatever it is
#Don't Worry - Be Happy, I'm not worried, I'm happy . . . .
