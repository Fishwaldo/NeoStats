* NeoStats * M & Fish * Version 3.0.a3-dev
==============================================================================
Important information you should know: (READ THIS!)
==============================================================================

This is an alpha release. Not all features will work and there may be major 
bugs in the software. This release is purely for us to get feedback on the new 
version of NeoStats and should not be run on production networks. This release
is ideal for users with test networks or those that want an opportunity to 
help us develop the new version with feedback and suggestions. It also allows
module coders to begin porting their modules to the 3.0 API and making any
requests and suggestions they wish. 

No support is provided for this release so if you have problems and are unable 
to resolve them using the provided documentation, you should use the supported 
stable 2.5 series instead until NeoStats 3.0 is further along. 

Bugs, requests and suggestions should be reported using the bug tracking 
system. You must provide all information required as listed in the README 
section on support or your entry will be removed.

NeoStats 3.0 will co exist with an existing 2.5 series installation so you
can run both together for testing this version if you wish.

Settings and data files from 2.5.x will not work with 3.0. 

Settings and data files for previous 3.0 alpha versions may not be compatible
with this version. You should delete all files with "gdbm" in the filename
from the directory ~/NeoStats 3.0/data before using this version.

Known issues that we are aware of and should not be reported:

==============================================================================
* I get a link error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lperl during the make step
of the installation on Debian. What's wrong?

- You need to install the libperl-dev package.

Alternatively, create a symbolic link from libperl.so.5.6.1 to libperl.so in
/usr/lib:

    % cd /usr/lib; ln -s libperl.so.5.6.1 libperl.so
and re-run the make step of the installation.

or if you dont want to take advantage of perl modules and extensions, then
you can run ./configure --disable-perl
