* NeoStats * M & Fish * Version 2.5.9
==============================================================================
Important Changes you should know: (READ THIS!)
==============================================================================
RedHat 9.0 / Fedora / Slakware 9.0 Users:
        There have been some changes to the RedHat/Fedora 9.0 and slakware 9 Kernels that
	affects NeoStats. If you are running RedHat 9.0 or Fedora or Slakware 9.0 please 
	read http://www.neostats.net/boards/viewtopic.php?t=391
 
Unreal Users:
	Due to compatibility issues between Unreal 3.1.x and 3.2.x series of
	IRCd's we have no had to change the ./configure options so you now have to
	specify --enable-unreal31 or --enable-unreal32 depending on what version of
	Unreal you use. 

SQL Server Emulation:
	NeoStats can now Emulate a PostgreSQL Server. This means you can use
	PHP/Perl to query Stats directly. This is Experimental at this stage, and
	chances are it might crash your NeoStats. Read README.sqlsrv in the docs
	directory for more information. 

Command Syntax:
	Some of the commands for bots have changed. Consult the Online help
	for the exact syntax of the commands.
